# OpenPush Android Client

OpenPush is a simple platform that I implemented in PHP and JavaScript in order to centralize my push notifications support.

This Android client runs in the background and pulls messages once in a while.

## Installation
The app is on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nadav.tasher.openpush).
